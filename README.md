# Robot-Manipulator - Algorithms

This file has the information about robot manipulation algorithms using python to visualize the information and show the example of how to use python as a tool on robotics to implement algorithms.


It is the idea to include the following algorithms

- Resolved Motion Rate Control (RMRC)
- Implementation of symbolic algorithms to compute dynamic equations using the Newton-Euler method
- Computed-Torque Control
