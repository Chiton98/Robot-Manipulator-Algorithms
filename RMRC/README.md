# Resolved Motion Rate Control Algorithm (RMRC)

## Definition
The Resolved Motion Rate Control Algorithm(RMRC)
is a kinematics based algorithm to control the 
trayectory of the robot where the input is the
end effector trajectory, without having to compute
the inverse kinematics of the robot; it uses the
jacobian matrix to achieve the control *ADD REFERENCE*

## Folder description
This folder contains the Python implementation of the
algorithm to follow a circular trajectory on cartesian space.
